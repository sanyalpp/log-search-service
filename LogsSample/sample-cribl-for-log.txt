The Master of Information Technology Security (MITS) program is a graduate professional program that prepares
individuals to work in the high-demand IT security industry. The program adopts a project method that provides
students with the experience to apply core course materials to a substantial project in the workplace during the latter part of the program.
The MITS program is one of the first of its kind in Canada and one of few specialized IT security graduate
degree programs available in the world. Through theory and applied learning, the program enables students to
develop an extensive understanding of business and information technology security, polish communication skills and examine business and IT ethics in a team environment.
To achieve the objectives of the program and to enhance students' learning experience,
it is important for the program to provide students with the necessary hands-on skills and knowledge.
The Faculty of Business and Information Technology provides a Hacker Research Lab to enhance the curriculum of the MITS program.
This lab facility hosts an array of network settings and consists of a variety of network equipment and wireless devices in a secure setting.
It offers students a secluded environment within which to work on various IT security projects and experiments.
The MITS curriculum contains the domains found in the Certified Information Systems Security Profession (CISSP) exam.
The curriculum also provides students with the opportunity to apply core course concepts to a substantial project in the workplace.
This plan of study introduces students to the fundamental knowledge of the ever-changing IT security field.
MITS graduates will not only be able to understand and apply the best of current practice but will
also be able to act as managers of transformation to improve that practice as the field evolves.
MITS graduates are prepared to work in different levels as IT security professionals.
